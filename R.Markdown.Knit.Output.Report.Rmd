## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo = FALSE}
glimpse(mpg)
```

## Highway vs City Mileage by Vehicle Type

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes( x = cty,
                        y = hwy,
                        color = class)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "City Mileage",
       y = "Highway") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
```
